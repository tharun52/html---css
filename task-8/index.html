                <p>Joel Miller is a character in the video game series The Last of Us by Naughty Dog. In the games, he is portrayed by Troy Baker through motion capture and voice acting; in the television adaptation, he is portrayed by Pedro Pascal. In the first game, The Last of Us (2013), Joel serves as the main protagonist and is tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a potential cure for an infection to which Ellie is immune. He also appears briefly in the downloadable content campaign The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014). Joel is killed in The Last of Us Part II (2020) by a woman named Abby, whose father he murdered in the first game, prompting Ellie to seek revenge.</p>

                <p>In this continuity, Peter Parker has been Spider-Man for eight years, and he and Mary Jane are no longer in a relationship. He does not work for The Daily Bugle anymore, but instead works as an assistant to Dr. Otto Octavius, who was Peter's idol and father figure until he sought revenge on Mayor Norman Osborn. Octavius releases the Devil's Breath virus to tarnish Osborn's image, at the cost of many residents of New York City being infected, such as Peter's Aunt May. After a climactic battle against Doctor Octopus, Peter reclaims the cure to the Devil's Breath virus, but is unable to save May as the sample was needed to reproduce it, and May's condition had progressed to the point where she died before a cure could be mass-produced. May reveals that she knew about Peter's identity as Spider-Man.</p>
